# Implementing and Benchmarking a Fibonacci Heap
**_Unittest Files_** 
* testFib.py
* testBinomialHeap.py
* testMinHeap.py

**_Data Structure Files_**
* fibHeapFinal.py - to use import fibHeapFinal and create a new instance, e.g. H = fibHeapFinal.FibHeap()  
The instance methods can be called as usual with the dot operator, e.g. x,y = H.extractMin() will return a value, key pair for the minimum entry in the heap.

*binomialheap.py - this operates as the above FibHeap file does.  Import and use as you would any python class.

* minheap.py- this operates as the above FibHeap file does.  Import and use as you would any python class. 
   
**_Dijkstra’s Algorithm_**
* dijkstra.py - Executing this file from the command prompt will run an example of Dijkstra'so algorithm.
   
**_Graphing_**
* Edgelists folier (these were the source edge lists for graphs used in our timing tests of Dijkstra with different inputs.
* edgelist_creation.m - this was used to create random graphs.  Included here for informational purposes. 
* graph.py - dependent file for dijkstra.py
* vertex.py - dependent file for dijkstra.py
